// The += operator can also append variables to a string

// Example
var anAdjective = "awesome!";
var ourStr = "freeCodeCamp is ";
ourStr += anAdjective;

// Only change code below this line

var someAdjective = "going to make me lots of money!";
var myStr = "Learning to code is ";
myStr += someAdjective;

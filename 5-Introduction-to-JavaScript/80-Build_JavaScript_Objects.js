// A JS Object is a data structure that is indexed by properties. Properties can be strings or numbers. Non-string properties will automatically be treated as strings. This means that one-name string properties can omit quotations.

// Example
var ourDog = {
  "name": "Camper",
  "legs": 4,
  "tails": 1,
  "friends": ["everything!"]
};

// Only change code below this line.

var myDog = {
  name: "Doggo",
  legs: 4,
  tails: 1,
  friends: ["me", "you"],
};

console.log((myDog))

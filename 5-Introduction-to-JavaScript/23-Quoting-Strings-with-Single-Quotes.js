// Strings can use single or double quotes but need to start and end with the same type of quote.

// It's useful for when a string includes quotations or apostrophes.

// In this example, different quote types allow the anchor tag to include attributes in quotation marks without a backslash to escape.

var myStr = '<a href="http://www.example.com" target="_blank">Link</a>';

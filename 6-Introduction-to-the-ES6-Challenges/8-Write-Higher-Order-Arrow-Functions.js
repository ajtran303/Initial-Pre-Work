// Arrow functions are good with higher order functions.

// These functions include map(), filter(), and reduce() and are used for processing lots of data. They take functions as arguments, so using arrow functions will allow for more concise writing. They might also return a function.

// Below more information from Mozilla documentation and from YouTube tutorial https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4awPsyugS0

// The map method creates a new array. The contents are from a function that is passed into it.

// The filter method creates a new array that uses elements that meet the conditions specified in the function passed into it.

// The reduce method will execute a given function to output one value.

<!-- Radio buttons are a type of input can be used for questions that have multiple options but only require one selection, like a multiple choice quiz.

When radio buttons are related, they need to have the same name attribute to create a radio button group. That way, selecting one answer will automatically deselect another answer so that only one can be chosen at a time.

Each radio button can be nested in its own label element to automatically associate the input with the surrounding label elements.

Best practice in example:

<label for="indoor">
  <input id="indoor" type="radio" name="indoor-outdoor">Indoor
</label>

"indoor" is a shared value between the for and id attributes of the label and input elements, respectively. This helps assistive technologies understand the linked relationship between the elements to increase accessibility.

<!-- The img element is used to add images. It includes a src attribute, that links to the image, and an alt attribute, which provides text to be displayed for screen readers or if the image fails to load. The best practice is to always include the alt attribute and if an image is purely decorational, use an empty alt attribute. -->

<!-- The img tag is self-closing and doesn't require a closing tag. <img src="https://www.your-image-source.com/your-image.jpg" alt="Author standing on a beach with two thumbs up."> -->
